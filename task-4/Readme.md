## Understanding Advanced Xor

There is a script (advanced_xor.py) that encrypts plaintext provided as an input using a key generated using urandom and gives the ciphertext as output. A ciphertext with 242 characters has been provided that has been encrypted using the given script. Another script check_hash.py has been provided to check if an answer is generated.
